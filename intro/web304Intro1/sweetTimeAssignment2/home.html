    <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
    <p>
            The year was 2003 and the idea of creating a small, funky chocolate factory was born in the minds of David Castellan and Cynthia Leung. The concept: finding new ways to create and enjoy chocolate.

            <h3>Cacao Bean SOURCING</h3>
            <br />

            Before we mold the chocolate into bars the chocolate must be tempered. This involves melting and cooling the chocolate to promote the proper crystallization of the cocoa butter molecules.
